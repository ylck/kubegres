    - #52 : Allow Kubegres cluster to run on secure Kubernetes environments (add security field "securityContext")

- Scheduled for May 2022:
    - #20 : Delete PVC

- Scheduled for June 2022:
    - #12 : Reuse PVC (see below) and Primary becomes a Replica

    As part of the available options for the field "failover.pvc", there would be:
        - "keep": the default option currently with Kubegres where PVC are kept but not reused for safety and investigation reasons
        - "delete": the PVC will be deleted
        - "reuse": if the state of the PVC is healthy, it will be reused by the newly created Replica pod. I think that matches with your suggestion?
